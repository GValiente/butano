### Apex Audio System

The Apex Audio System (AAS) is a sound library for the GBA. It includes a highly
efficient mixer, MOD playing routines and support for up to 16 channels. It is
designed for developers using a GCC-based development environment. AAS uses RAW,
WAV or *tracker 1-16 channel MOD files as input.


## Documentation

AAS is fairly well documented. From building the library to a starter guide to
an extensive description of the api. See <root>/docs/index.html


## History

Apex Audio System was made by James Daniels of Apex Systems back in 2003 for the
GBA version of Payback. The library underwent several revisions, the latest of
which was v1.11. At the beginning of 2021, James was so kind to donate the
sources to the community, hence this Git repo.


## Latest release

The current release is v1.13. See the documentation for a list of changes.

## License

AAS is now distributed under the MIT license. For licensing terms, see the

James only had one request when handing over the sources: that users of the
library include a credit to Apex Designs. In essence this is now covered by the
MIT license. It's up to you how you want to fill this in, but please be
respectful of this requirement.
