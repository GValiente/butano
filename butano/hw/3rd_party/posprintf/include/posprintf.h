If you wish to port this to other ARMmachines, you may need to alter this code. I believe that most ARM machinessupport SWI 7 as an alternative software divide, although you will have toswap the numerator/denominator registers (r0 and r1).*** END CAUTION ***My contact e-mail is: dan at danposluns dot com*/#ifndef _PSPRINTF_HEADER_#define _PSPRINTF_HEADER_extern void posprintf(char *, const char *, ...);#endif
