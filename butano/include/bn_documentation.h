/**
 * @page getting_started Getting started
 *
 * Downloading, building and making your own games with Butano is easy and doesn't take too much time, pinky promise.
 *
 * @tableofcontents
 *
 * @section getting_started_supported_platforms Supported platforms
 *
 * Butano is built on top of the <a href="https://devkitpro.org/">devkitARM</a> toolchain,
 * so it supports Windows, macOS and Unix-like platforms.
 *
 * @section getting_started_emulator GBA emulator
 *
 * Before anything, it is convenient to have a GBA emulator at hand,
 * so you don't have to test in real hardware each change you make in your project.
 *
 * For developing GBA games, <a href="https://mgba.io/">mGBA</a>
 * and the debug version of <a href="https://problemkaputt.de/gba.htm">No$gba</a> are recommended.
 *
 *
 * @section getting_started_devkitARM devkitARM
 *
 * The next step is to download and install devkitARM
 * from <a href="https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started">devkitPro</a>:
 * * Install the `GBA Development` component.
 * * Install **all members** in the `gba-dev` group if the installer asks for which members to install.
 * * Make sure that **with the console** you are able to build and run some of the examples
 *   located in `/path/to/devkitpro/examples/gba`:
 *   * By default, devkitARM is installed in `C:\devkitPro\` on Windows and in `/opt/devkitpro/` on Ubuntu.
 *   * To build a devkitARM example open the console, `cd` to the folder of the example you want to build
 *     and type `make -j8` if your CPU has 8 cores, `make -j16` if it has 16 and so on.
 *   * In particular, you should build and run the Maxmod example located in
 *     `/path/to/devkitpro/examples/gba/audio/maxmod` before going on.
 *
 * @image html devkitpro.png
 *
 * @image html devkitpro_ubuntu.png
 *
 *
 * @section getting_started_python Python
 *
 * To execute some of the tools needed to include image and audio files in your project,
 * you are going to need <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.
 *
 * If you are going to install Python on Windows,
 * remember to add it to the PATH and to close all command line windows before installing it:
 *
 * @image html python_windows.png
 *
 * Both Python 2 and Python 3 are supported for now, but Python 2 is not going to be supported for too long.
 * Make sure you can execute Python from the command line:
 *
 * @image html python.png
 *
 * @image html python_ubuntu.png
 *
 *
 * @section getting_started_butano Butano
 *
 * Download or clone the latest Butano release from <a href="https://github.com/GValiente/butano">GitHub</a>
 * and put it in a path without spaces or anything weird like that, please.
 *
 *
 * @section getting_started_examples Butano examples
 *
 * Butano contains multiple @ref examples "examples" of most aspects of the engine.
 *
 * Make sure that you are able to build and run some of them:
 * * They are located in `/path/to/butano/examples/`.
 * * As with devkitARM examples, to build a Butano example open the console, `cd` to the folder of the example
 *   you want to build and type `make -j8` if your CPU has 8 cores, `make -j16` if it has 16 and so on.
 *
 * When trying to build the `sprites` example, if everything went as expected,
 * a `sprites.gba` file should have been generated in the `sprites` folder,
 * and the console should show something like this:
 *
 * @image html example_build.png
 *
 * @image html example_build_ubuntu.png
 *
 *
 * @section getting_started_template Make your own GBA game!
 *
 * If you were able to build and run some examples, congrats! Now you can make your own GBA game with Butano.
 * To do that:
 * * Copy the template project located in `/path/to/butano/template/` to a path without spaces nor weird characters.
 * * Change in the `Makefile` the path in which Butano library folder is located.
 *   For example, if Butano is located in `/path/to/butano/`,
 *   `LIBBUTANO` variable should be set to `/path/to/butano/butano`.
 * * If you want, you can also change ROM title, ROM code and more in the `Makefile`.
 * * `cd` to the new folder.
 * * Type `make -j#cpu_cores#` again.
 *
 * If everything went as expected, a `*.gba` file should have been generated in the project folder!
 * Now learn how to @ref import "import your assets" in the game and
 * also take a look at the <a href="modules.html">modules</a> page.
 * The @ref faq "frequently asked questions (FAQ)" are worth a look too.

/**
 * @page examples Examples
 *
 * Learn by example to get quickly up to speed.
 *
 * The examples assume that you have at least basic knowledge about:
 * * Modern C++ (Butano is based on modern C++ concepts like shared ownership, RAII, standard containers...).
 * * Old school 2D graphics (what are sprites, backgrounds, color palettes...).
 * * Basics of retro game development (at least to know that floating point usage is a no-no and things like that).
 *
 * Deep knowledge of GBA hardware is not required, as Butano wraps most of the functionality in its own classes.
 *
 * As always, to understand how the little machine works, <a href="https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm">Tonc</a>
 * and <a href="http://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm">GBATEK</a> are your friends.

/**
 * @page import Importing assets
 *
 * @tableofcontents
 *
 * Importing your graphic and audio files into a GBA game can be annoying,
 * but with Butano and this guide you will be good to go.
 *
 * GBA ROMs by themselves don't include a file system, so you can't put a couple of `*.bmp` files into a folder
 * and expect to read them directly from the GBA side.
 *
 * This means that all the game's data has to be added directly to the binary.
 * Don't worry, because Butano build system does this for you.
 * When you drop a file into an assets folder, Butano:
 * * Generates a GBA-friendly version of it.
 * * Inserts it into the ROM.
 * * Creates a C++ header into the `build` folder containing the required information to use the assets with ease.
 *
 * Let's see how to import image and audio files.
 *
 *
 * @section import_image Images
 *
 * By default image files go into the `graphics` folder of your project.
 *
 * Butano for now is a little finicky about the images it likes, sorry.
 *
 * The required image format is the following:
 * * BMP without compression nor color space information.
 * * 16 or 256 colors only.
 * * The first color in the color palette is the transparent one, so in most cases it will not be shown on screen.
 *
 * If you are using <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> for your images,
 * remember to disable color space information:
 *
 * @image html import_gimp.png
 *
 * However, the recommended tool to ensure that your images are compatible
 * with Butano is <a href="https://www.coranac.com/projects/usenti/">Usenti</a>:
 *
 * @image html import_usenti.png
 *
 * Usenti is a simple bitmap editor for paletted images,
 * it is like the good old Paint but with various palette/color manipulation tools.
 *
 * If you are not going to use Usenti for your images, at least remember to check them with it
 * when they are not displayed as expected.
 *
 * A single `*.bmp` file is not enough to display graphics on the GBA.
 * You must accompany it with a `*.json` file with the same name specifying if it is a sprite or a background
 * and some more info.
 *
 * Let's see how to do it.
 *
 *
 * @subsection import_sprite Sprites
 *
 * An image file can contain multiple sprite images.
 * If it only contains one sprite image, its size must be one of the specified by @ref bn::sprite_shape_size.
 *
 * Multiple sprite images are allowed by layering them down on the vertical axis:
 *
 * @image html import_sprite.png
 *
 * An example of the `*.json` files required for sprites is the following:
 *
 * @code{.json}
 * {
 *     "type": "sprite",
 *     "height": 64
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The fields for sprites are the following:
 * * `"type"`: must be `"sprite"` for sprites.
 * * `"height"`: height of each sprite image in pixels.
 * For example, if the specified height is 32, an image with 128 pixels of height contains 4 sprite images.
 * * `"tiles_compression"`: optional field which specifies the compression of the tiles data:
 *   * `"none"`: uncompressed data (this is the default option).
 *   * `"lz77"`: LZ77 compressed data.
 *   * `"run_length"`: Run-length compressed data.
 *   * `"auto"`: uses the option which gives the smallest data size.
 * * `"palette_compression"`: optional field which specifies the compression of the colors data:
 *   * `"none"`: uncompressed data (this is the default option).
 *   * `"lz77"`: LZ77 compressed data.
 *   * `"run_length"`: Run-length compressed data.
 *   * `"auto"`: uses the option which gives the smallest data size.
 * * `"compression"`: optional field which specifies the compression of the tiles and the colors data:
 *   * `"none"`: uncompressed data (this is the default option).
 *   * `"lz77"`: LZ77 compressed data.
 *   * `"run_length"`: Run-length compressed data.
 *   * `"auto"`: uses the option which gives the smallest data size.
 *
 * If the conversion process has finished successfully,
 * a bn::sprite_item should have been generated in the `build` folder.
 *
 * For example, from two files named `image.bmp` and `image.json`,
 * a header file named `bn_sprite_items_image.h` is generated in the `build` folder.
 *
 * You can use this header to create a sprite with only one line of C++ code:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * #include "bn_sprite_items_image.h"
 *
 * bn::sprite_ptr sprite = bn::sprite_items::image.create_sprite(0, 0);
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @subsection import_sprite_tiles Sprite tiles
 *
 * An image file can contain multiple sprite tiles sets.
 * If it only contains one sprite tiles set,
 * the size of the image must be one of the specified by @ref bn::sprite_shape_size.
 *
 * Multiple sprite tiles sets are allowed by layering them down on the vertical axis:
 *
 * @image html import_sprite.png
 *
 * An example of the `*.json` files required for sprite tiles is the following:
 *
 * @code{.json}
 * {
 *     "type": "sprite_tiles",
 *     "height": 64
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The fields for sprite tiles are the following:
 * * `"type"`: must be `"sprite_tiles"` for sprite tiles.
 * * `"height"`: height of each sprite tiles set in pixels.
 * For example, if the specified height is 32, an image with 128 pixels of height contains 4 sprite tiles sets.
 * * `"compression"`: optional field which specifies the compression of the tiles data:
 *   * `"none"`: uncompressed data (this is the default option).
 *   * `"lz77"`: LZ77 compressed data.
 *   * `"run_length"`: Run-length compressed data.
 *   * `"auto"`: uses the option which gives the smallest data size.
 *
 * If the conversion process has finished successfully,
 * a bn::sprite_tiles_item should have been generated in the `build` folder.
 *
 * For example, from two files named `image.bmp` and `image.json`,
 * a header file named `bn_sprite_tiles_items_image.h` is generated in the `build` folder.
 *
 * You can use this header to create sprite tiles with only one line of C++ code:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * #include "bn_sprite_tiles_items_image.h"
 *
 * bn::sprite_tiles_ptr sprite_tiles = bn::sprite_tiles_items::image.create_tiles();
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @subsection import_sprite_palette Sprite palettes
 *
 * An example of the `*.json` files required for sprite palettes is the following:
 *
 * @code{.json}
 * {
 *     "type": "sprite_palette"
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The fields for sprite palettes are the following:
 * * `"type"`: must be `"sprite_palette"` for sprites.
 * * `"colors_count"`: optional field which specifies the palette size [1..256].
 * * `"compression"`: optional field which specifies the compression of the colors data:
 *   * `"none"`: uncompressed data (this is the default option).
 *   * `"lz77"`: LZ77 compressed data.
 *   * `"run_length"`: Run-length compressed data.
 *   * `"auto"`: uses the option which gives the smallest data size.
 *
 * If the conversion process has finished successfully,
 * a bn::sprite_palette_item should have been generated in the `build` folder.
 *
 * For example, from two files named `image.bmp` and `image.json`,
 * a header file named `bn_sprite_palette_items_image.h` is generated in the `build` folder.
 *
 * You can use this header to create a sprite palette with only one line of C++ code:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * #include "bn_sprite_palette_items_image.h"
 *
 * bn::sprite_palette_ptr sprite_palette = bn::sprite_palette_items::image.create_palette();
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @subsection import_regular_bg Regular backgrounds
 *
 * An image file can contain only one regular background.
 * The size of a small regular background (which are faster) must be 256x256, 256x512, 512x256 or 512x512 pixels.
 * Big regular backgrounds are slower CPU wise and don't support wrapping (they can't be moved beyond their boundaries),
 * but can have any width or height multiple of 256 pixels.
 *
 * An example of the `*.json` files required for regular backgrounds is the following:
 *
 * @code{.json}
 * {
 *     "type": "regular_bg"
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The fields for regular backgrounds are the following:
 * * `"type"`: must be `"regular_bg"` for regular backgrounds.
 * * `"palette_item"`: optional field which specifies the name of the bn::bg_palette_item to use for this background.
 * * `"bpp_mode"`: optional field which specifies the bits per pixel of the regular background.
 * This field is required if an external bn::bg_palette_item is referenced with `"palette_item"`:
 *   * `"bpp_8"`: up to 256 colors per @ref tile "tile".
 *   * `"bpp_4_auto"`: up to 16 colors per @ref tile "tile".
 * Butano tries to quantize the image to fit the color palette into the required one.
 * It is not supported if an external bn::bg_palette_item is referenced with `"palette_item"`.
 *   * `"bpp_4_manual"`: up to 16 colors per @ref tile "tile".
 * Butano expects that the image color palette is already valid for this mode.
 *   * `"bpp_4"`: `"bpp_4_manual"` alias.
 *
 * The default is `"bpp_4_manual"` for 16 color images and `"bpp_8"` for 256 color images.
 * * `"repeated_tiles_reduction"`: optional field which specifies if repeated tiles must be reduced or not
 * (`true` by default).
 * * `"flipped_tiles_reduction"`: optional field which specifies if flipped tiles must be reduced or not
 * (`true` by default).
 * * `"tiles_compression"`: optional field which specifies the compression of the tiles data:

 *   * `"none"`: uncompressed data (this is the default option).
 *   * `"lz77"`: LZ77 compressed data.
 *   * `"run_length"`: Run-length compressed data.
 *   * `"auto"`: uses the option which gives the smallest data size.
 * * `"compression"`: optional field which specifies the compression of the tiles, the colors and the map data:

 *   * `"lz77"`: LZ77 compressed data.
 *   * `"run_length"`: Run-length compressed data.
 *   * `"auto"`: uses the option which gives the smallest data size.
 *
 * If the conversion process has finished successfully,
 * a bn::regular_bg_item should have been generated in the `build` folder.

 *
 * bn::regular_bg_ptr regular_bg = bn::regular_bg_items::image.create_bg(0, 0);
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @subsection import_affine_bg Affine backgrounds
 *
 * An image file can contain only one affine background.
 * The size of a small affine background (which are faster) must be 128x128, 256x256, 512x512 or 1024x1024 pixels.
 * Big affine backgrounds are slower CPU wise and don't support wrapping (they can't be moved beyond their boundaries),
 * but can have any width or height multiple of 256 pixels.
 *
 * An example of the `*.json` files required for affine backgrounds is the following:
 *

 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The fields for affine backgrounds are the following:

 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @subsection import_bg_palette Background palettes
 *
 * An example of the `*.json` files required for background palettes is the following:
 *
 * @code{.json}
 * {
 *     "type": "bg_palette",
 *     "bpp_mode": "bpp_8"
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The fields for background palettes are the following:

 * @code{.cpp}
 * #include "bn_bg_palette_items_image.h"
 *
 * bn::bg_palette_ptr bg_palette = bn::bg_palette_items::image.create_palette();
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @section import_audio Audio
 *
 * By default audio files go into the `audio` folder of your project.
 *
 * Audio stuff is managed by the awesome <a href="https://maxmod.devkitpro.org/">Maxmod</a>,
 * so if you have an issue with music or sound effects, well, you know.
 *
 * A really nice application for editing audio files
 * before importing them into your game is <a href="https://openmpt.org/">OpenMPT</a>.
 *
 *
 * @subsection import_music Music
 *
 * The required format for music are module files (files with `*.mod`, `*.xm`, `*.s3m` and `*.it` extensions).
 *
 * By default Butano supports up to 16 music channels,
 * but this limit can be increased by overloading the definition of @ref BN_CFG_AUDIO_MAX_MUSIC_CHANNELS.
 *
 * However, if it is possible don't do this, don't make the poor GBA suffer.
 *
 * If the conversion process has finished successfully,
 * a bunch of bn::music_item objects under the `bn::music_items` namespace
 * should have been generated in the `build` folder for all music files.
 * You can use these items to play music with only one line of C++ code:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * #include "bn_music_items.h"
 *
 * bn::music_items::song.play();
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @subsection import_sound Sound effects
 *
 * The required format for sound effects is waveform audio files (files with `*.wav` extension)
 * without compression or anything weird. Besides, *I think* stereo files are not allowed.
 *
 * The recommended quality for sound effects is 8-bits 22050 Hz.
 *
 * If the conversion process has finished successfully,
 * a bunch of bn::sound_item objects under the `bn::sound_items` namespace
 * should have been generated in the `build` folder for all sound files.
 * You can use these items to play sound effects with only one line of C++ code:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * #include "bn_sound_items.h"
 *
 * bn::sound_items::sfx.play();
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @section import_fonts Fonts
 *
 * By default fonts files go into the `fonts` folder of your project.
 *
 * Common fonts for English, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) and Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong) are provided in `common` folder.
 *
 * They are based on open source font <a href="https://source.typekit.com/source-han-serif/">Source Han Serif</a> under <a href="https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif/blob/master/LICENSE.txt">OFL-1.1 License</a>.
 *
 * If you want to:
 * * support other languages
 * * display rare characters
 * * change font style and size
 * * exclude unused characters to save space
 * You can import your own fonts too.
 *
 *
 * @subsection import_bmfont Bitmap Font
 *
 * A bitmap font file (.fnt) in text format is supported. You can make it using <a href="http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/">Bitmap Font Generator</a> or <a href="https://snowb.org/">Bitmap Font Generator Online</a>.
 * It is also a common font format used in generic game engines like <a href="https://docs.cocos.com/creator/manual/en/asset/font.html">Cocos</a>, <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/bitmap-font-importer-62128">Unity</a> and visual novel engines like <a href="https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/text.html?highlight=text#image-based-fonts">Ren'Py</a>.
 *
 * First of all, <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html">install Pillow</a>.
 *
 * @code{.sh}
 * # For MSYS2/MinGW-w64 users
 * pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python-pillow
 * # For WSL2/Ubuntu/Debian users
 * sudo apt-get install python3-pil
 * # For Mac users
 * brew install pillow
 * # For FreeBSD users
 * pkg install py38-pillow
 * # For CentOS users
 * yum install python3-pillow
 * # For Fedora Linux users
 * dnf install python3-pillow
 * # For Arch Linux users
 * pacman -S python37-pillow
 * @endcode
 *
 * Place `*.fnt` and `*.png` files in the `fonts` folder. Notice that `*.png` files should have background color instead of transparent background.
 *
 * If the conversion process has finished successfully,
 * a bunch of bn::sprite_font objects should have been generated in the `build` folder for all fonts files.
 *
 * For example, from two files named `items.fnt` and `items.png`,
 * a header file named `items_sprite_font.h` is generated in the `build` folder.
 *
 * You can use these fonts to display text with only one line of C++ code:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * #include "items_sprite_font.h"
 *
 * bn::sprite_text_generator text_generator(items_sprite_font);
 * @endcode

/**
 * @page qt_creator Qt Creator setup guide
 *
 * @tableofcontents
 *
 * Qt Creator is a cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE) built for the maximum developer experience.
 * Qt Creator runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS desktop operating systems,
 * and allows developers to create applications across desktop, mobile, and embedded platforms.
 *
 * Since it has lots of C++ advanced features for a free IDE, it is a good fit for Butano projects.
 *
 * This is a small tutorial for setting up Butano's template project in Qt Creator 4.14.
 * Although the guide has been made in Windows, the steps for other operating systems are similar if not the same.
 *
 *
 * @section qt_creator_getting_started Getting started
 *
 * Before messing with Qt Creator, make sure that you are able to build and run Butano projects from the command line.
 * The best way to achieve it is to read the
 * @ref getting_started "guide to download, install and start using Butano".
 *
 *
 * @section qt_creator_install Install Qt Creator
 *
 * If you don't have Qt Creator installed yet, you can get it from <a href="https://www.qt.io/offline-installers">here</a>.
 *
 * @image html qt_creator/qt_0.png
 *
 *
 * @section qt_creator_compilers Compilers
 *
 * Once you have Qt Creator installed, add devkitARM GCC and G++ compilers from `Tools -> Options -> Kits -> Compilers`:
 *
 * @image html qt_creator/qt_1.png
 *
 * @image html qt_creator/qt_2.png
 *
 *
 * @section qt_creator_kit Kit
 *
 * Add a new kit with the previous devkitARM compilers from `Tools -> Options -> Kits -> Kits`:
 *
 * @image html qt_creator/qt_3.png
 *
 * You can ignore the yellow triangle: it is a warning, not an error.
 *
 *
 * @section qt_creator_import Import template project
 *
 * Now that you have the kit setup, import Butano's template project from `File -> New File or Project...`:
 *
 * @image html qt_creator/qt_4.png
 *
 * @image html qt_creator/qt_5.png
 *
 * @image html qt_creator/qt_6.png
 *
 * @image html qt_creator/qt_7.png
 *
 *
 * @section qt_creator_cpp_20 C++20
 *
 * Enable C++20 support in the `template.cxxflags` file with the following line:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * -std=c++20
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @section qt_creator_include_paths Include paths
 *
 * Add the following paths to the `template.includes` file:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * include
 * build
 * ../butano/include
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @section qt_creator_build_settings Build settings
 *
 * Disable `all` build target from `Projects -> Build Settings -> Build Steps`:
 *
 * @image html qt_creator/qt_8.png
 *
 *
 * @section qt_creator_run_settings Run settings
 *
 * Add your favorite GBA emulator from `Projects -> Run Settings -> Run`:
 *
 * @image html qt_creator/qt_9.png
 *
 *
 * @section qt_creator_build_and_run Build and run
 *
 * Finally, build and run the template project by clicking at the bottom left arrow (the one without the roach please).
 *
 * If everything went as expected, your GBA emulator of choice should show a nice black screen. Congrats!

/**
 * @page faq Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
 *
 * @tableofcontents
 *
 *
 * @section faq_general General
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_how_do_i How do I-
 *
 * The best way to get started is to read the
 * @ref getting_started "guide to download, install and start using Butano".
 *
 * After that, there are various @ref examples "examples" explaining most aspects of the engine.
 *
 * At last, check how to @ref import "import" your own assets in a game and
 * take a look at the <a href="modules.html">modules</a> page.
 *
 * This page is worth a look too.
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_sell_money Would I be able to sell my game made with Butano for money?
 *
 * Sure!
 *
 * If you comply with <a href="https://github.com/GValiente/butano/blob/master/LICENSE">Butano license</a>
 * and <a href="https://github.com/GValiente/butano/tree/master/3rd_party_licenses">third party libraries licenses</a>
 * used by Butano you can sell your game without issues.
 *
 *
 * @section faq_programming Programming
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_cpp Can I use Butano without knowing C++?
 *
 * While Butano is easy to use if you have some C++ skills,
 * it is going to be hard to work with it if you don't know nothing about C++,
 * so you should learn a bit of C++ before diving into Butano.
 *
 * After that, maybe you can learn both C++ and Butano at the same time while you make a game,
 * but if you don't want to have a hard time with Butano you should know the basics of C++ before messing with it.
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_ide Is there any good free IDE for Butano projects out there?
 *
 * Take a look at the @ref qt_creator.
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_incomplete_type Why I get an incomplete type error when trying to use a Butano class?
 *
 * If you have an error like these:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * error: variable 'bn::regular_bg_ptr bg' has initializer but incomplete type
 * error: invalid use of incomplete type 'class bn::regular_bg_ptr'
 * error: aggregate 'bn::fixed' has incomplete type and cannot be defined
 * @endcode
 *
 * It is almost always because of lack of included headers.
 *
 * You can find the header of each Butano class in its documentation page.
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_containers Why there's std like containers included with Butano?
 *
 * Butano containers differ from the standard library ones in two important points:
 * * They don't use the heap, their content is always on the stack.
 * * They don't throw exceptions. @ref assert are used instead.
 *
 * Since avoiding heap usage and exceptions is usually good for GBA development,
 * use Butano containers whenever possible.
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_heap So I shouldn't use the heap?
 *
 * Since heap usage is slow and the heap allocator included with Butano is very limited,
 * avoid heap usage whenever possible.
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_memory_types Why I run out of memory so often?
 *
 * Besides VRAM and such, the GBA provides two memory banks:
 * * IWRAM: 32KB fast RAM.
 * * EWRAM: 256KB slow RAM.
 *
 * Data is allocated in IWRAM by default, so it is common to run out of memory if you don't use EWRAM.
 *
 * To place data in EWRAM, you can:
 * * Allocate memory in the heap, since it is in EWRAM.
 * * Declare static data with the `BN_DATA_EWRAM` macro:
 * @code{.cpp}
 * BN_DATA_EWRAM static_data data;
 * @endcode
 *
 * However, if the data is read only, you can avoid wasting RAM by placing it in ROM with the `const` qualifier:
 * @code{.cpp}
 * const const_data data;
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_destroy_ptr How to destroy sprites and backgrounds?
 *
 * bn::sprite_ptr, bn::regular_bg_ptr and all Butano classes that end with the `_ptr` suffix are
 * `std::shared_ptr` like smart pointers that retains shared ownership of a hardware resource.
 *
 * In the case of bn::sprite_ptr, several bn::sprite_ptr objects may own the same sprite.
 * The sprite is released when the last remaining bn::sprite_ptr owning it is destroyed.
 *
 * If you want to learn more about `std::shared_ptr`, you can read:
 * * <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/auto_ptr-unique_ptr-shared_ptr-weak_ptr-2">A basic introduction of standard smart pointers</a>.
 * * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/how-to-create-and-use-shared-ptr-instances?view=msvc-160">A std::shared_ptr usage guide</a>.
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_destroy_optional That's cool, but how can I destroy and reload sprites and backgrounds as easy as possible?
 *
 * bn::optional helps to unload and reload hardware resources easily:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * // bg_optional is empty:
 * bn::optional<bn::regular_bg_ptr> bg_optional;
 *
 * // bg_optional now contains the background specified by bn::regular_bg_items::bg1:
 * bg_optional = bn::regular_bg_items::bg1.create_bg(0, 0);
 *
 * // bg_optional is empty again:
 * bg_optional.reset();
 *
 * // bg_optional now contains the background specified by bn::regular_bg_items::bg2:
 * bg_optional = bn::regular_bg_items::bg2.create_bg(0, 0);
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_float_double Can I use float or double when coding for the GBA?
 *
 * Normally CPUs have dedicated hardware for processing `float`s and `double`s, called an FPU.
 * The GBA doesn't have one, so you're left with 2 choices:
 *
 * * Using soft float, which is floating point emulated in software (*very* slow).
 * * Using fixed point arithmetic, which is just integer arithmetic with a few extra steps.
 *
 * Butano provides bn::fixed, which tries to be as close as possible to a `float` with fixed point arithmetic.
 * Use it when you want to work with numbers with decimal points.
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_sprintf How do I print a number in a string?
 *
 * *Don't* use `sprintf`, `std::ostring_stream` nor anything that comes with the standard library, because:
 *
 * * Butano functions for printing numbers in strings can be more than 5 times faster than the standard functions.
 * * Standard functions can take more than 4KB of IWRAM.
 * * Standard functions sometimes can't be used because they give link errors.
 *
 * If you want to print a number in a string with Butano, bn::to_string provides the easiest way to do it:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * bn::string<16> string = bn::to_string<16>(number);
 * @endcode
 *
 * If you want to compose a string with multiple numbers, you can use bn::ostringstream too:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * bn::string<64> string;
 * bn::ostringstream string_stream(string);
 * string_stream << "Text: ";
 * string_stream << 123;
 * string_stream << " - ";
 * string_stream << number;
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_global_objects Does Butano allow to declare bn::sprite_ptr or bn::regular_bg_ptr objects globally?
 *
 * In general, you should not do anything with Butano before calling bn::core::init,
 * including creating global Butano objects.
 *
 * If you want to declare global Butano objects, you can do something like this instead:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * struct global_data
 * {
 *     bn::sprite_ptr sprite;
 *     bn::regular_bg_ptr bg;
 * };
 *
 * global_data* global_ptr;
 *
 * int main()
 * {
 *     bn::core::init();
 *
 *     global_data global_instance = {
 *         bn::sprite_items::sprite_item.create_sprite(0, 0),
 *         bn::regular_bg_items::bg_item.create_bg(0, 0)
 *     };
 *
 *     global_ptr = &global_instance;
 *
 *     // ...
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * And then you can access global Butano objects from anywhere in your code with something like this:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * global_ptr->sprite.set_position(50, 50);
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_wait_updates Is there a way to stop running my code for a certain amount of time?
 *
 * Since you can usually assume than your game is running at 60FPS, you can wait a second for example with this:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * for(int index = 0; index < 60; ++index)
 * {
 *     bn::core::update();
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_utf8_characters How can I print UTF-8 characters like japanese or chinese ones?
 *
 * bn::sprite_text_generator already supports UTF-8 characters rendering,
 * and the bn::sprite_font instances used in the examples provide CJK characters including japanese and chinese,
 * but it is not included and linked by default to save space,
 * so you will have to add them to Makefile to enable them according to your needs.
 *
 * Refer to <a href="https://github.com/laqieer/gba-dev-best-practice/tree/main/source/common-text">this</a> to learn how to do it.
 *
 * If you want to print other UTF-8 characters, you can import your own font. Read @ref import "this" to learn how to do it.
 *
 * @subsection faq_tonc_general_notes Are there some more general notes on GBA programming out there?
 *
 * <a href="https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/first.htm#sec-notes">I'm glad you asked</a>.
 *
 *
 * @section faq_color Colors
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_transparent_color Which color is the transparent one?
 *
 * Butano supports 16 or 256 color images only, so they must have a color palette.
 *
 * The transparent color is the first one in the color palette,
 * so in order to change it you should use a bitmap editor with color palette manipulation tools,
 * like <a href="https://www.coranac.com/projects/usenti/">Usenti</a>:
 *
 * @image html import_usenti.png
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_share_palettes How to share the same color palette between sprites or backgrounds?
 *
 * If two sprites or backgrounds have the same colors, by default they share the same color palette.
 *
 * Keep in mind that unused colors are also taken into account when deciding if two color palettes are equal or not.
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_multiple_8bpp_objects Why everything looks weird when I show two or more backgrounds or sprites with more than 16 colors?
 *
 * Since the GBA has only two 256 color palettes (one for sprites and the other for backgrounds),
 * if you use for example two backgrounds with more than 16 colors,
 * Butano assumes that they have the same color palette (same colors in the same order).
 *
 * So if you are going to show at the same time multiple backgrounds with more than 16 colors,
 * use the same color palette with all of them (in the same scene of course,
 * different backgrounds shown in different scenes can have different color palettes).
 *
 *
 * @section faq_backgrounds Backgrounds
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_bg_wrapping Why some backgrounds don't allow wrapping?
 *
 * If you try to move a big background beyond its boundaries, an error like this one should be displayed:
 *
 * @image html faq_bg_wrapping.png
 *
 * That's because big backgrounds don't allow wrapping, so if you are using a big background,
 * avoid moving it beyond its boundaries (or avoid using big backgrounds).
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_big_background What's a big background?
 *
 * The GBA only supports some fixed sizes for background maps.
 *
 * However, Butano allows to manage background maps with any size multiple of 256 pixels.
 * These special background maps and the backgrounds that display them are called big maps/backgrounds.
 *
 * Try to avoid big backgrounds whenever possible, because they are slower CPU wise and
 * don't support wrapping (they can't be moved beyond their boundaries).
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_regular_affine_background Why there are two types of backgrounds (regular and affine)?
 *
 * It seems it is always better to use affine backgrounds, since they can be rotated, scaled, etc.
 * and its size can be up to 1024x1024 pixels without becoming big backgrounds.
 *
 * However, compared to regular backgrounds, affine backgrounds have these limitations:
 * * Only two of them can be displayed at the same time, instead of four.
 * * They don't support 16 color tiles, only 256 color ones.
 * * They only support up to 256 different tiles, instead of 1024.
 *
 * Because of these limitations, you should avoid affine backgrounds whenever possible.
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_background_error_grit Why can't I import a regular background with 1024 or less tiles?
 *
 * If you get this error when trying to import a regular background with 1024 or less tiles:
 *
 * `error: Regular BGs with more than 1024 tiles not supported: 1025`
 *
 * Or you get this error when importing an affine background with 256 or less tiles:
 *
 * `error: Affine BGs with more than 256 tiles not supported: 257`
 *
 * Your image is fine, but <a href=" https://www.coranac.com/projects/grit/">grit</a>
 * (the tool used by Butano to import images) is generating unneeded extra tiles.
 *
 * The only workaround that I know of is reducing detail in your input image until the tiles count of
 * the generated background is valid.
 *
 *
 * @section faq_audio Audio
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_music_crash Why the game crashes when some songs are played?
 *
 * Butano uses the excellent <a href="https://maxmod.devkitpro.org/">Maxmod</a> library for audio support.
 *
 * It provides impressive performance and support for lots of module music formats,
 * but unfortunately it crashes with some songs.
 *
 * Sometimes it helps to change song's file format (for example, from `*.xm` to `*.it`).
 * You can use <a href="https://openmpt.org/">OpenMPT</a> to do that.
 *
 * You can also try to create a new issue in its
 * <a href="https://github.com/devkitPro/maxmod/issues">GitHub issues</a> page,
 * but since it seems the library was abandoned long time ago, don't hold your hopes up too much.
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_music_missing_notes Why there are missing notes when playing some songs?
 *
 * If a song doesn't have more channels than the maximum number of active music channels
 * specified by @ref BN_CFG_AUDIO_MAX_MUSIC_CHANNELS, as before,
 * sometimes it helps to change its file format (for example, from `*.xm` to `*.it`).
 * You can use <a href="https://openmpt.org/">OpenMPT</a> to do that.
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_audio_quality How can I improve audio quality?
 *
 * If you have some free CPU left, you can increase audio mixing rate to improve its quality.
 *
 * The easiest way to specify the audio mixing rate for a specific project is
 * to define it in the `USERFLAGS` of its `Makefile`.
 *
 * For example, to set the audio mixing rate to 21KHz:
 *
 * `USERFLAGS := -DBN_CFG_AUDIO_MIXING_RATE=BN_AUDIO_MIXING_RATE_21_KHZ`
 *
 * Remember to rebuild your project from scratch after modifying a `Makefile`.
 *
 * Available mixing rates are @ref audio "here".
 *
 *
 * @section faq_flash_carts Flash carts
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_flash_carts_start Why my game runs fine on emulators but doesn't work on a real GBA with a flash cart?
 *
 * Some flash carts allow to improve commercial games with patches like `saver patch`, `enable restart`,
 * `enable real time save`, etc.
 *
 * These patches can break homebrew games, so try to disable some or all of them if you run into any issues.
 *
 *
 * @subsection faq_flash_carts_sram Why SRAM works on emulators but doesn't work with this old flash cart?
 *
 * While SRAM works out-of-the-box with most modern flash carts, it can fail with some older ones.
 *
 * To fix it you can try to:
 * * Set save type as SRAM.
 * * Disable or enable save patches.
 * * Update the firmware of the flash cart.
